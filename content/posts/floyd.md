The day after I bought the [spacebook.app](https://spacebook.app) domain and launched my project, daughter #1 sent me a PDF containing a old-school zine that represented one of her freshman year final projects at the University of Minnesota. She took all of the photos at 38th and Chicago; I loved it but the PDF format was horrible! It took about 15 minutes to screenshoot and resize the images, and about 15 minutes to launch [Say our names](https://say-our-names.netlify.app/):
