During the 2020 pandemic I had to write a lot documentation for various projects, and took my free time to learn about better ways to do this.  Google Docs and Basecamp are great tools, but sometimes a simple website is the best way to effectively document and explain an idea or a project. 

The problem is that even as an experienced web developer of more than 25 years, building a "simple" website is not so simple these days. This led me down the road to find the simplest possible way to spin up a modern website in the least amount of time, with the freedom to extend as needed, zero cost, no maintenance burden, and virtually zero effort. 

This road led directly to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) which quickly led to the creation of my own starter kit called [spacebook](https://spacebook.app). I'm now using it for lots of things (including this site), and in just a few weeks we have:

* 20 Github stars!
* 2 contributors 
* 2 (conflicting) feature requests

With not much more effort than creating a new Google Doc, anybody can spin up a new spacebook for anything. It is privacy first (with options for full password protection), writing focused, customizable, and very fun to work on.
