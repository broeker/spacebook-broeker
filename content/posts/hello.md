Hello and welcome to broeker.dev, a personal homepage.  I built my first personal homepage at `boombox.umn.edu/~broeker` way back in 1994, before CSS or JavaScript existed. I maintained some sort of homepage through the early 2000s, and even maintained a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060206092517/http://mambofrog.com/" target="_blank">popular dev blog</a> for a few years that grew to several thousand readers a day.

Now in 2021 it is time to turn the lights back on, in some form or another. This site is built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and my new project called [Spacebook](https://spacebook.app/) -- in many ways, this technology stack is a lot like the web pages I was building 25 years ago and it feels great.
