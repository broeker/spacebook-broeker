My name is Tim Broeker (aka Citizen Tim) and I have been building the web 1994. I am a co-founder and technical director at [Electric Citizen](https://www.electriccitizen.com/), a digital agency that does great work for great clients and causes in the public sector. Many years ago, I had a client who introduced me to the concept of the [Winter Count](https://cutt.ly/djoBsTw), a Lakota tradition of marking the significant events of each year with small pictures or a few words. If you'd like to learn more about me, feel free to read my winter count below.

* **2019** -- completed [four talks](/speaking) in California, Iowa, and Minnesota about the modern web, leaned heavily into React and modern JavaScript, experimented heavily with Svelte and Vue, bought nodeapi.io to host my own Node APIs for fun 
* **2018** -- spoke at [DrupalCon Nashville](https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018), introduced to Gatsby at BadCamp, thus beginning my obsession with new and [better ways to build websites](https://jamstack.org/) in a way that is very different from what we have been doing for the past 20 years (but yet so much the same; see my entry from 1994!)
* **2017** -- began my obsession with [devops and automation](https://www.electriccitizen.com/citizen-blog/drupal-8-devops-automation-happier-teams-and-clients) of all the things; spent most of the year bringing myself and our team into the modern age
* **2016** -- spent most of the year helping to grow our team, and refining our [Drupal 7 install profile](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/install/using-an-installation-profile), with heavy and early usage of Panels, Panelizer, and Media modules

* **2011** -- attended my first [DrupalCon (Chicago)](https://chicago2011.drupal.org/); by this point, Drupal 7 is out and I am deeply in love with the platform and convinced that it can be used to build almost anything

* **2008** -- a tough year with some strange clients, taking work we do not want to take, feeling the effects of the [housing crisis and financial collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis), and battling the [depression](https://alistapart.com/article/mental-illness-in-the-web-industry/) that started four years ago when Pops died

* **1995** -- bought my first home [14.4K modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem), rarely left my bedroom for the next two years as I learned how to build the web; began accepting small freelance projects, CSS and JavaScript were not yet a real thing 
* **1994** -- discovered [Mosiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)) and Linux, built my first personal homepage, and became the founding editor of the Minnesota Daily Online (to my knowledge, the third daily newspaper in the country to begin publishing its entire contents to the web on a daily basis -- ours was an automated Perl script we called the "cooker", which extracted text from Quark Express and generated the full site on each build. A giant static site generator publishing dozens of articles and photos 5 days a week, year around, in 1994!) 
* **1993** -- switched majors to Journalism, and began working as a political and legal reporter at the [Minnesota Daily](https://mndaily.com); a significant turning point in my life
